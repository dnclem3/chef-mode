Be sure to serve this with a side of Garlic Bread with Cheese!

One Pot Spaghetti 
My favorite part about this recipe, other than the fact that there is just one pot to clean at the end, is that the spaghetti noodles cook in chicken or beef broth, which makes them so much more flavorful.
Onions and peppers add a classic homemade touch that reminds me of my grandmother’s spaghetti. The seasonings are simple and a dab of cream cheese at the end adds an amazing touch that sets this apart from the rest!
It also makes a great freezer meal, I love reheating this for easy lunches and dinners.
How to Make It
See recipe card below this post for ingredient quantities and full instructions.
Cook and crumble the ground beef and onions over medium-high heat. Add the diced peppers, garlic, and seasonings during the last 2-3 minutes. Set aside on a separate plate and drain any grease.
Add chicken broth to the pot and bring to a boil. Add the uncooked noodles and allow them to soften, then use kitchen tongs to twist them into the pot.

Add the undrained diced tomatoes, then the marinara sauce and cream cheese.

Submerge the pasta underneath. Cover partially and simmer until cooked through, the pasta will take about 15-20 minutes total. Periodically run a silicone spatula along the bottom of the pot to ensure the pasta doesn’t stick.
Add the meat mixture back to the sauce and heat through. Serve with garlic bread with cheese.

Pro Tips

Ground sausage or a combination of beef and sausage may be used.
Rao’s marinara sauce is my preferred store bought brand, or make my homemade marinara sauce.
This recipe is also Instant Pot friendly.
Mushrooms make a great addition to this meal as well.
If you plan on having leftovers, consider adding slightly more marinara sauce as the noodles will absorb more liquid during storage.
If it feels as though you need more liquid for the pasta to finish cooking, add a little more broth. Conversely, if your sauce feels too thin, let it simmer, uncovered, until the additional liquid has evaporated.
