Homemade rib marinade is used in this barbecue ribs recipe that's easier than it looks. I usually cook the ribs the day before and grill them for a quick dinner the next night. The sauce is much better after it is cooked; it is not a dipping sauce.

 Bake in the preheated oven for 1 ½ hours. Unwrap and drain drippings. (I usually freeze drippings to use later in soups.) Place ribs in a large roasting pan.

I marinated the ribs for about 4 hours, then followed the direction for finishing them in the oven since I do not have a grill. The ribs were sticky and had good flavor but were dry and the sauce never thickened. I will make and use the sauce again but will cook the ribs differently.

Soooooo easy and soooooo good!!! I followed another reviewer’s recommendation and boiled the ribs on low for 2 hours, then marinated in the sauce overnight. While they were on the grill for 30 mins (15 mins each side), I simmered the remaining marinade down to a thick sauce and poured over the ribs when they were done. The meat was super tender and the sauce was finger licking good!!! Will make this over and over and over.
