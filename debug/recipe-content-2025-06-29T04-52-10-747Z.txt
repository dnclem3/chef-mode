These spinach and feta turkey burgers are a big hit in the summertime when everyone is tired of the same old hamburgers and hot dogs. Serve with or without buns and your favorite condiments. I like to serve these with lettuce, tomato, and tzatziki sauce.

  cooking spray


2 pounds ground turkey


1 (10 ounce) box frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry


4 ounces feta cheese


2 large eggs, beaten


2 cloves garlic, minced



Directions


 Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.




 Mix together turkey, spinach, feta, eggs, and garlic in a large bowl until well combined; form into 8 patties.




 Cook patties on the preheated grill on both sides until no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of patties should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Sooo good!!! I served mine on flat bread topped with carmelized red onion, bean sprouts, tomato, cucumber and homemade tzatziki. My kids were wary at first but they have all asked me to make it again next week!!

These burgers were epic! So good and so healthy. Thanks for the share. Just added more garlic. Amazing. Will be making again and again - less red meat is a win in our house.

I added feta and frozen kale. Ah-ma-zing!!! Cooked the burgers on indoor grill doing quarter turns every three minutes four times (12minutes). Garnished with arugula and tomato slice.
